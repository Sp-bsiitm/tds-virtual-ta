    "content": "# Tools in Data Science - Jan 2025\n\n[Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>This course exposes you to real-life tools</strong></summary>\n\nCourses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\n\nBut one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\n\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\n\n- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.\n- You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.\n- You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes.\n\n[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) \"We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.\"](https://explainxkcd.com/224/)\n\nIn this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.\n\nLearn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>This course is quite hard</strong></summary>\n\nHere's students' feedback:\n\n- It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)\n- Now it's hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/45)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t1-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-may-2024-term/127856/60)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t2-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-september-2024-term/144976/62?u=s.anand)\n- Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/11)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/4)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/7)\n- LLMs grade you -- unpredictably.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/10)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/wrong-marks-in-project-2/160355/9)\n- The ROE is hard.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/is-it-fair-to-consider-20-weightage-of-such-exam-which-is-impossible-to-solve-in-given-time-i-e-roe/141413/10)\n\n**[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) to check if you're ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Programming skills are a pre-requisite</strong></summary>\n\nYou need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\n\n**But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\n\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\n\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>We encourage learning by sharing</strong></summary>\n\nYou _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n**Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.\n\n**To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.\n\n**To learn better, teach** what you've learnt.\n\n</details>\n\n## We cover 7 modules in 12 weeks\n\nThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the [commit history](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/commits/tds-2025-01/) for changes.\n\nReleased content:\n\n1. **[Development Tools](../development-tools.md)** and concepts to **build** models and apps.

Students have till 2 Feb 2025 - more than the 10 days expected for a GA.\n- 22 Jan 2025: GA2 submission date moved from 26 Jan 2025 to 2 Feb 2025. GA4 release date is moved from 24 Jan 2025 to 31 Jan 2025. This is to reduce the amount students have to learn in a short period.\n- 29 Jan 2025: GA3 submission date moved from 2 Feb 2025 to 5 Feb 2025.\n- 13 Feb 2025: GA5 submission date moved from 16 Feb 2025 to 21 Feb 2025.\n- 15 Feb 2025: Project 1 deadline moved from 15 Jan 2025 to 16 Feb 2025.\n- 26 Feb 2025:\n  - Project 1 results will be released by 16 Mar 2025.\n  - Graded Assignment 6 moved from 14 Feb to 28 Feb 2025. Submission date moved from 9 Mar to 16 Mar 2025.\n  - Project 2 moved from 21 Feb to 3 Mar 2025. Submission date moved from 17 Mar to 31 Mar 2025.\n  - Graded Assignment 7 moved from 28 Feb to 7 Mar 2025. Submission date moved from 16 Mar to 26 Mar 2025.\n- 7 Mar 2025: GA7 release date moved from 7 Mar to 14 Mar 2025.\n\n### Notes\n\n- **[Graded Assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) checks course pre-requisites**. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.\n- \u2021 **Graded Assignments: Best 4 out 7**. We'll take the best 4 out of your graded assignments submissions. These, combined, will have a 15% weightage.\n- **Remote exams are open and hard**\n  - You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...\n  - The RoE is especially hard. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2)\n- **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. It tests your memory. It's easy.\n- **Projects test application**. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context.\n- **Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks)\n- **Evaluations are mostly automated**. This course uses pre-computed (for objective) or LLMs (for subjective) evaluations.\n  - LLMs will evaluate you differently each time. Learn to prompt them _robustly_ to get higher marks.\n\n## Constantly check communications\n\nCheck these three links regularly to keep up with the course.\n\n1. **[Seek Inbox](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/)** for Course Announcements.
